### David's update:
- teaching has become more time consuming
- developing the simulation stuff more
- continuing planning/prep for bitswap strategy competition for 2018
 - Evan and David agreed that delving into theory (SMT solvers or Renormalization Group) is likely less practical than simulations
- continuing to write bitswap spec
- thinking more about game theory, writing up a .tex summary
